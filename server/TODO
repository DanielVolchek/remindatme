Server reads for websocket connections
When a websocket connection is received it reads for a new message
message contains a json structured as so:

{
    todays_date: DATE
    days_till_reminder: INT
    body: BODY
    subject: SUBJECT
    user_email: EMAIL
}

Upon receiving the json it is processed into a struct
The function will check if the date of the reminder is the same as the date of the operation
If it is not on the same date, 
dispatch it to a database of email messages to send
If it is on the same date,
dispatch it to the program which will set up the emailing function

Emailing function:
Once a day using cronjob check the dates of each reminder in database
Every day where days_till_reminder is not 0, subtract one day from each unit
