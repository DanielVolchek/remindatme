Server reads for websocket connections
When a websocket connection is received it reads for a new message
message contains a json structured as so:

{
    days_till_reminder: INT
    reminder_time: TIME
    subject: SUBJECT
    body: BODY
    user_email: EMAIL
}

Fields are as such:
days_till_reminder: comes from webapp by calculation
reminder_time: time of day specificed in 24HR time
subject: subject of email to be sent
body: body of email to be sent 
user_email: email to send to

Upon receiving the json it is processed into a struct
The function will check if the date of the reminder is the same as the date of the operation
If it is not on the same date, 
dispatch it to a database of email messages to send
If it is on the same date,
dispatch it to the program which will set up the emailing function

Emailing function:
Once a day using cronjob restart go email program
go email program checks db where days_till_reminder is not 0, subtract one day from each unit
makes list of reminders where day is 0 and sets up time.sleep timers based on the specified time of day
All unspecified times will be set to email at 2PM UTC
